# Quantum Negative Selection Algorithm

This project demonstrates the implementation of the **Negative Selection Algorithm (NSA)** using **Quantum Computing** frameworks. The NSA is a computational method inspired by biological immune systems to detect non-self patterns in datasets. The quantum version of this algorithm utilizes quantum circuits for improved pattern recognition and similarity checking.

The main objective of this project is to showcase the combination of classical immune algorithms and quantum computing techniques to solve pattern recognition problems more efficiently.

## Key Features:
- **Quantum Negative Selection**: Uses quantum circuits to perform pattern recognition by encoding antigens and detectors.
- **Artificial Immune Algorithms**: The project implements various artificial immune system algorithms, including:
  - Negative Selection (NSA)
  - Clonal Selection
  - Artificial Immune Network (AIN)
  - Danger Theory
  - Dendritic Cells
